# Vanilla Boot

Projects' guiding principles:

* Non pervasive - You can do anything you could do in Vanilla
* Download only used modules (or decide which modules to preload)
* No JSX (use only standard html)
* No Reactivity (no mystery why things happen or don't when something doesn't go as planned)
* Free form (no surprises, nothing to learn, no complex flow required for your code, every module can be different - full flexibility)
* No Virtual Dom
* Access dom elements by predictable ids
* Framework is written in short and simple code, no stratified object oriented hell
* No compilation (easy to reverse engineer starting from browser)
* No chunking to incoherent little code pieces
* Due to no framework as base and fewer dependabilities, we get long term reliability (no framework change will cause this project to be unusable)
